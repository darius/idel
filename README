To test:                make test
To run:                 ./run tests/hello.idel
To install:             make install
To remove:              make uninstall

To stop it:             bin/kill-jobber


ABOUT

Idel is a virtual machine for safely and portably running untrusted
code.  This is not a new programming language, but a substrate for
existing ones.  It's designed to:

 * be relatively language neutral
 * control resource consumption
 * support mobility and persistence
 * need only an auditably small trusted computing base
 * yield small object files and fast execution
 * accommodate capability-based security in a coming release
 * be easy to incorporate in other programs, the way Tcl is.

See:
 notes/Overview.text    for more motivation.
 doc/tutorial.text      for an intro to Idel's assembly language.
 man idelasm            about invoking the assembler.
 man idelvm             about invoking the runtime.
 examples/borednet      for an example application (CPU sharing)
 examples/roshambo      for another amusing example (bot wars)
 doc/specification.text for an (incomplete) virtual machine spec.

This preview release isn't meant for serious use.  Some important
features are missing, and others will change incompatibly later on.

PORTABILITY

To build this, you need:

 * GNU Make
 * awk
 * an ANSI C (C89) compiler

Also, the borednet and roshambo examples use Python, and the test
suite uses the C preprocessor (cpp) that ought to come with your C
compiler but occasionally doesn't.

It's been tested on the following systems:

        CPU             OS               Compiler
        -----------     ------------     ------------
        Alpha           Linux 2.2        gcc 2.95.2
        i386            FreeBSD 4.5      gcc 2.95.3
        i686            Linux 2.0.36     gcc 2.95.4
        i686            Linux 2.4        gcc 2.95.2
        PowerPC G4      Darwin 5.4       gcc 2.95.2
        RS/6000         Linux 2.4        gcc 2.95.2
        Sparc Ultra60   Linux 2.2        gcc 2.95.2
        Sparc R220      Solaris          gcc 2.95.2
        Sparc R220      Solaris          Sun WorkShop 6 update 1 C 5.2 [1]

[1] For Sun's compiler, you must set the -Xa option in CFLAGS to get
it to expect ANSI C.  Changing -O2 to -fast looks like a good idea, too.

Earlier versions were also tested on these, and may still work:

        i586            FreeBSD 4.2      gcc 2.95.2
        i686            Win2k/Cygwin     gcc 2.95.3-5
        PowerPC         Darwin 1.2       gcc 2.7.2.1

If it doesn't work out of the box for you, please let me know.
