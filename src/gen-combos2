some pseudocode for now:

read in the basic blocks and their counts

for each basic block:
	for each subsequence:
		increment its count by the basic block's count

while not done:

	pick the (op, ops) pair that most reduces the instruction count
	add it to frequencies as a new `ops' object
	write it out
	replace its instances in basic blocks with the new operation



the amount a pair (op, ops) reduces the instruction count is:

	the frequency that op is followed by ops
