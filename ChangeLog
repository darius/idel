New in 0.1.11pre ()

 - tweaked the test scripts to work with newer cpp


New in 0.1.10 (1 August 2002):

 - added flush-output instruction
 - examples/roshambo contributed by Luke Gorrie


New in 0.1.9 (11 May 2002):

 - now works on the Alpha, and should be 64-bit clean in general
 - added doc/cvsinstall.text
 - bugfix: when -profile was on and a basic block got split across
   dynamically allocated code chunks, the profile output would barf
 - bugfix: exit status of idelvm should be 128 when command line args
   are wrong, not 1
 - fixed vm->at_jump_target (it was misplaced, but not in a way that
   currently matters)
 - tweaked test scripts to run on Solaris


New in 0.1.8 (15 Feb 2002):

 - moved executables into bin/
 - fixed makefiles to work with sh as well as bash
 - fixed borednet Python code to conform to coding standards
 - some cleanup of object encoding/decoding
 - added bin/jobber
 - small borednet improvements
 - hashcash demo for borednet


New in 0.1.7 (3 Feb 2002):

bugfixes:
 - assembler was misparsing # line directives from the C preprocessor,
   yielding wrong line numbers in error messages
 - assembler `ints:' directive now word-aligns the new symbol

other:
 - added profiling and -profile switch
 - speedup by combining instruction sequences into superinstructions
 - speedup by specializing instructions to particular immediate
   arguments
 - a couple of other performance tweaks to the interpreter
   (improved scheduling of next-instruction fetch, and offset to stack
   pointer)
 - distributed work of returning() throughout codegen in preparation
   for multiple backends (no more inspection of already-generated
   instructions)
 - added bss-data: declarations to the assembler
 - added character constants to the assembler
 - added SHA-1, quicksort, Boyer-Moore-Horspool, and sieve benchmarks
 - improved codegen error messages
 - renamed `:' to `def' since it's not the same as the Forth `:'
 - renamed the shift operators with the Java names (<<, >>, >>>)


New in 0.1.6 (18 Jan 2002):

bugfixes:
 - assembler occasionally segfaulted on undefined defns

other:
 - assembler supports hex constants
 - assembler is smarter about the Zeroes tag


New in 0.1.5 (16 Jan 2002):

incompatible changes:
 - stack pickling is now disabled unless you run idelvm with the
   -development flag.  Documenting the design revealed flaws in it that
   just aren't worth the trouble right now to fix.  (See notes/stacks.text)

other:
 - added examples/borednet
 - now has an API and builds a library implementing it
 - added Zeroes tag to object file format

	
New in 0.1.4 (18 Dec 2001):

incompatible changes:
 - execution now starts at the first defn, not the last
   (this will enable pipelined downloading and execution of object files)
 - idel programs now must return an exit code

bugfixes:
 - fixed vm bug (stack checker skipped over implicit ELSE clauses)

other:
 - eliminated recursive makefiles (now requires GNU Make)
 - conditionalized gcc-specific flags in Makefile
 - increased assembler hashtable size
 - added byte-data sections to the object format
 - assembler chooses between byte-data and int-data sections intelligently
 - got rid of magic numbers for word size all over the place
 - added huffman example
 - made sure of signed/unsigned mismatches compiler warned about
 - removed hard limit on token length in idelasm
 - minor code cleanup
 - tests check the status code returned, not just the output
 - added dependencies on idelasm, idelvm in Module.mk of some examples


New in 0.1.3 (12 Dec 2001):

incompatible changes:
 - now forbids unaligned word access

bugfixes:
 - fixed assembler bug (allowed reference to out-of-scope local)

other:
 - changed name
 - added calculator example
 - added testexamples target to the makefile
 - integer div, mod in portability.h
 - changed makefile to put idelasm & idelvm in the main directory
 - added a contrib/ directory with Luke Gorrie's elisp code
 - using cpp as preprocessor to the assembler
 - assembler gives source locations in error messages
 - assembler understands line-number directives from cpp
 - assembler may take multiple input files
 - space and time limits are arguments to idelvm instead of constants
 - added some microbenchmarks
 - runtime error messages now come prefixed with the program name
 - added -version, -help options
 - split out the main() from codegen.c
 - man pages
 - added idelrun and cppidelasm scripts for development convenience
 - added an option to set the #! line in idelasm
 - added doc/tutorial.text
 - some code cleanup
