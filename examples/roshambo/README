Roshambo Game
========================================

This package includes a game engine and some example contestants.

roshambo.py is the Python source for game engine. It includes a
description of the simple stdio-based protocol.

*.idel are the example robots.

"make test" will run a test tournament (see Makefile for how to invoke
the engine).

NOTE: You need to install Idel first (or change this Makefile to refer
to your local copy of the idelvm/idelasm binaries).

So: read the code, write a robot, and kick some bottom! Robots should
be "submitted" on IRC, in either source (.idel) or binary (.bot) form.
